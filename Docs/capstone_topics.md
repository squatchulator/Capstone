### Topic Ideas
* [Elasticsearch AI] is a ChatGPT integration built directly into Elasticsearch with the intent of making alert and case analysis easier on the part of SOC analysts. Issue is, the integration is proprietary and locked behind a paywall. The goal of this is to reverse-engineer this GPT integration either for use with Elasticsearch or with its open-source alternative, OpenSearch.
* [Leahy Center Client Infrastructure] is a project geared towards getting infrastructure planned, purchased, built, and secured for one of the security/IT clients of the Leahy Center.
