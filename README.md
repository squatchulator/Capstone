Generator, a local makerspace adjacent to The Leahy Center, faces significant IT infrastructure challenges leading to communication breakdowns, security vulnerabilities, and scalability limitations. Our capstone group (Miles, Max, Nico, and Jacob) designed our project around devloping a tailored solution for Generator. The purpose of this project was to fortify Generator's technological foundation, striking a balance between security and business functionality.

The most recent incident that Generator faced really inspired this idea. An individual installed cryptocurrency mining software on multiple of Generator’s endpoints, consuming resources and driving up the power bill. This incident is one of the many risks that Generator is susceptible too that we aimed to mitigate:

We aimed to fortify Generator’s technological foundation, transforming it into a secure, efficient, and resilient organization. We recognize the pressing challenges stemming from fragmented communication, inconsistent software use, and vulnerabilities in our current IT infrastructure. This project consisted of retrieving funding, constructing a implementation plan, purchasing equipment/licenses, 

### Objectives: 
```
- Retrieve Funding/grant 
- Segment network (Guest, Member, Device, Infra) & creating new WiFi networks
- Implement two supermicro servers to act as Domain Controllers to enhance network redundancy and configure necessary services (DHCP, DNS, AD/DS)
- Implement Power Supply Unit
- Construct Acceptable Use Policy
- Provide Generator users with new individualized accounts
- Domain-join Generator workstations 
```
### Outcomes: 
```
- Funding recieved, CAL licenses, Windows licenses (Server 2022 x2, Windows 10 Pro x18), Battery Backup, and SuperMicro Servers obtained and configured
- Network segmented into 4 separate networks (Default/Infrastructure, Staff, Member, Guest)
- Domain controllers configured in redundancy with DHCP, DNS, AD/DS, File Shares, Periodic Backups, Site Replication
- Power supply unit installed and attached to all network cabinet components
- Acceptable Use Policy created
- Account deployment script created (both current member deployments and script for new member deployments) and operational
- Generator workstations joined to domain generator.local
```
