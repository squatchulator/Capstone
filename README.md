> These topics are the two that I have decided to research as of Week 1 of FA'23. The first project regarding Elasticsearch AI is the topic I am leaning more towards as of now as it better reflects my interests in both AI and working within a SIEM, and I feel that developing this could be of great use for the Leahy Center and for its SOC analysts. The second topic is still something I would enjoy working on, and would also be of benefit for the Leahy Center as well as the client we would be building infrastructure for.
