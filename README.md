Generator, a local makerspace adjacent to The Leahy Center, faces significant IT infrastructure challenges leading to communication breakdowns, security vulnerabilities, and scalability limitations. Our capstone group (Miles, Max, Nico, and Jacob) designed our project around devloping a tailored solution for Generator. The purpose of this project was to fortify Generator's technological foundation, striking a balance between security and business functionality.

The most recent incident that Generator faced really inspired this idea. An individual installed cryptocurrency mining software on multiple of Generator’s endpoints, consuming resources and driving up the power bill. This incident is one of the many risks that Generator is susceptible too that we aimed to mitigate:

We aimed to fortify Generator’s technological foundation, transforming it into a secure, efficient, and resilient organization. We recognize the pressing challenges stemming from fragmented communication, inconsistent software use, and vulnerabilities in our current IT infrastructure. This project consisted of retrieving funding, constructing a implementation plan, purchasing equipment/licenses,
